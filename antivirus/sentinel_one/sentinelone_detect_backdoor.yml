- name: "Sentinelone possible detection of a backdoor"
  severity: "High"
  description: "The backdoors allow the malicious user to control the infected computer, being able to send and 
                receive files, execute or delete them, display messages, delete or steal data, restart the computer, etc. 
                That is, you can control the computer as if you were sitting in front of it and at the controls."
  solution: "Use a sophisticated antivirus. Download carefully as you may find potentially unwanted applications. 
    Use a firewall, which can help prevent backdoor virus attacks. Use a password manager to help you manage your credentials. 
    Stay on top of security updates and patches. Use multi-factor authentication to increase security."
